Hello friend, and welcome to my new place. This is where I'll keep my ramblings that exceed 140 characters. I won't try to be regular but will make an effort regarding quality. My interests are information security, pen-testing, security research and other philosophically pertinent topics.

In the meantime, catch me on [@lgrangeia](https://twitter.com/lgrangeia) or check out my [About page](/about/).

*(the title of the post is a nod to [Mr. Robot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/), a TV show that you have already heard about if you like information security)*
