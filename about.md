My name is Luis Grangeia, and I'm an information security professional working in the field for about 15 years, mostly doing security audits and pen-tests.

I do information security auditing and testing to major portuguese and european companies (retail, banking, insurance, telcos). I sometimes speak about information security at conferences and meetings.

Some stuff that I put out there you might find interesting:

 - [Cupid](https://github.com/lgrangeia/cupid), an implementation of the heartbleed attack for wireless networks, implemented as patches for hostapd and wpa_supplicant (slides [here](http://www.slideshare.net/lgrangeia/heartbleed-35236317)).
 - I authored a [Burp Suite extension](https://github.com/lgrangeia/aesburp) to handle and inject inside AES encrypted payloads.
 - I wrote the original paper for [DNS Cache Snooping](http://cs.unc.edu/~fabian/course_papers/cache_snooping.pdf).
 - In another millenium I've co-authored a [phrack article](http://phrack.org/issues/55/12.html) that, among other things, implemented a covert TCP sniffer inside the Linux kernel.

All my recent slide decks are available on [slideshare.net](http://www.slideshare.net/lgrangeia).

I'm mostly interested in security research, covering the usual topics:

- Operation System design models (trusted path computing, security models, etc.);
- Web Application security (lots of experience here...);
- Low level protocols design and implementation;
- Debugging & disassembling software & hardware;
- Mobility and embedded systems, Android/IOS, wearables, IoT;
- Futurology, new uses for technology, new forms of interaction.
